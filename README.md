# Personal Paint

I developed this program when I was first learning advanced Java and object-oriented programming.

It's basically a white canvas over which different geometric shapes (e.g., points, lines, circles, Rectangles, Triangles, and polygons) with different colours and sizes can be added. After running the program, right-click on the white canvas, then select an option, and then follow the settings. Shapes can be grouped/ungrouped and edited. The canvas can also be saved and loaded later on to continue editing the shapes.
